# HCCEngineeringSociety

This repository contains files for the HCC Engineering Society's webpage.    The Engineering Society is a club at the Brandon campus of Hillsborough Community College in Tampa, Florida.

This website is one of things the Engineering Society is working on.   The group that works on it meets on the Discord programming channel at 9:30am on most Fridays.

Currently the website is in a developmental stage.   It is running on a virtual machine hosted by Digital Ocean.   The site itelf is a Flask app


In the short term we are planning to do the follow.   The site uses the Flask web application framework (https://flask.palletsprojects.co) that uses WSGI (https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to communicate to an NGINX (https://www.fullstackpython.com/nginx.html) webvserver.

THe plan is to coordinate our efforts through GitHub.

Right now we need volunteers to work on the following.
